# Ali-gorithmJourney

## Intro
Like most developers, algorithms intimidate me, but I recently decided to face algorithms ("ali-gorithms") head-on because I know I have to learn them if I want to be competitive in software development interviews.

This repo is a collection of all of the algorithm questions I have done. This repo is a living thing, which means I am usually always adding to it, and editing it, and am open to suggestions on my solutions. Please note that not every file is filled with code. Some are written answers as though I am in a white boarding interview. 

I'd like to cite Algoexperts.io as the source of these questions. Thanks Algoexperts!
